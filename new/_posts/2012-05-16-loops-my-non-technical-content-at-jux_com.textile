h3. A platform to share content with an uncanny sense of design.

A few days ago I found "Jux":http://jux.com while searching for a nice and clean on-line blogging platform.

It was love at first use.

The interface is so clean and the layouts so thoughtful.  I had to start using it right away.

Articles, pictures, bullet points, videos, and other type of content have their own unique layouts to make the most of it.

It's the perfect place for my non-technical content.

__I reserve the right to cross-post now and them if I think it makes sense__

Go ahead and "visit it now":https://theprogrammer.jux.com if you wish.
