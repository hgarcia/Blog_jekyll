One of my oldest OOS projects, the Gherkin editor have been having some attention lately with a few downloads, comments and issues been open.

I decided to take a few hours and at least fix what seems to be the main issue for users.

Now, opening features files will provide the proper syntax highlight in the text.

The new release is Beta 2 and is available at "http://gherkineditor.codeplex.com/":http://gherkineditor.codeplex.com/
