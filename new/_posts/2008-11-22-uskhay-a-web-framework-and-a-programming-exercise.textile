I will try to create a simple CMS framework on top of the ASP.Net MVC. This will be mostly an exercise, something that I feel I need to try to see how it works. Some of the goals:

* The framework will be extensible but opinionated.
* The views need to be composite and the markup created by the designer should be very simple with minimum or no code at all.
* The framework needs to provide a centralize Exception handler mechanism.
* Multiple sites in one install.
* Partial views should use a common interface (IViewModule?) so we can provide a modular architecture.
* Easy to template by a designer, easy to skin by a designer.
* HTML and CSS standards compliance friendly.

In line administration are fully backend integrated to the site.

* Testability is paramount, and the framework should come with a good set of unit test as part of the release.
* Been able to run the test from inside the framework, so install can diagnose problems.

I will be posting more about this and some code as soon as I have something put together.
