I was going to write a post about this but my thoughts are exactly the same as <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fredriknormen/archive/2008/12/01/controllers-in-the-mvc-pattern-is-not-a-replacement-for-business-logic-layer.aspx" target="_blank">Fredrik Normen's.</a>

For example, one thing that creeps me out is seen think like this in the Controller.

I don't think that the controller should ever touch the repository and of course it shouldn't do any type of validation besides data entry from the view.
