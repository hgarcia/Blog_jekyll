Now, with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/" target="_blank">Gurtle</a> you install this issue tracker provider that will log into your Google code account and pull all your issues into the commit dialog box for TortoiseSVN.

Another small download and easy install. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/wiki/Parameters" target="_blank">configuration</a> is a non issue and you should be up an running in minutes if not seconds.
