Last Friday I was showing some of the guys at the office how to write user stories with the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin" target="_blank">Gherkin</a> language to been able to use them in either <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> or <a href="http://specflow.org/" target="_blank">Specflow</a> as executable specifications.

They were receptive but they have a problem. Notepad. They wanted to use Word and have a template, and some spell checking supportâ€¦.

At first I got a little frustrated but I actually thought about it and try to put myself on their shoes. Here I'm, a developer, asking to the business to write specs in a very specific format. It's not that they were negative about it, but they were expressing they concerns and they needs.

h3. Enter Gherkin editor.

So I decided to try to create a simple editor with some of the features requested. I remembered some time ago <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=245" target="_blank">an interview on DNR with a PM for the SharpDevelop team.</a> He mentioned that they had the editor surface as either a service or a plug in. After searching I found it (<a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/Default.aspx?Page=AvalonEdit&amp;amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" target="_blank">AvalonEdit</a>) and <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/AvalonEdit.aspx" target="_blank">also a nice little sample app</a>.

So I got the code, read the documents and after a few hours of hacking with the sample I was able to put together a super basic editor.

I hosted the code in <a href="http://gherkineditor.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Codeplex</a> using Mercurial and just added the first <a href="http://gherkineditor.codeplex.com/releases/view/42100" target="_blank">Release 0.1 alpha</a>, work on my machine, use at your own risk, etc, etc.

h3. Some screenshots.

h3. Future plans

The next step will be to add spell checker and a template to create a new document. Contextual code completion could be a nice to have. Multi language support is a must for Cucumber.
