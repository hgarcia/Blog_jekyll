<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="VirtualBox">Virtualbox</a> is a free open source virtual machine software. I have been using it to run, Ubuntu, Fedora, BDS and a virtual XP machine with all the new stuff for testing and I love it.

The performance is great, installing the software can't be any easy and configuring the virtual machines is a breeze.

I totally recommend you give it a try.
