The book explain the rationality behind Dart and the use cases for it.

The book is mostly an overview of the main features of Dart and some of the tools you have available today. In it's only 20 pages (35 in the epub version on my iPad) this short book explains why the need for Dart and highlight some of the characteristics that made it a viable option for large web applications.

I think it's an OK book to get a general sense of the language, maybe can be used as a quick way to introduce it to some teams.

I did learn a thing or two about Dart that I wasn't aware of, increasing my interest on it.
