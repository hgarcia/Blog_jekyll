This book was my first exposure to Resource Oriented Computing and NetKernel.

"Tom Geudens":http://practical-netkernel.blogspot.ca/ does a good job introducing a very different way to approach programming.

The first three chapters will get you started with building and (somehow) understanding what a module is and how is created.

Chapter four show you how to interact with a db (MongoDb) and how to build something more complex and (useful).

The second part of the book digs deeper in the languages and tools included with NetKernel, like the nCoDe editor or the DPML and XRL languages.

_Be ready to read lots of XML in the book._

A big plus, at least for me, is that every chapter has a section on testing.

h3. Conclusion

If you want to learn ROC or you are interested in different approaches to computing programmers this book is for you.

The author has a very entertainment style that makes for an easier read on a subject that could be very dense otherwise.
