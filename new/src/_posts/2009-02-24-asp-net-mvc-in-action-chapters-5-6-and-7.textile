title: ASP.NET MVC in Action chapters 5,6 and 7.
summary: I enjoyed this chapters as well, specially chapter 6 and 7 about extending the framework and preparing your site so it scale. Some of the code examples are using a previous (old) version of the framework. I hope they will be updated for the print version.
categories: [Programming, .Net]

I enjoyed this chapters as well, specially chapter 6 and 7 about extending the framework and preparing your site so it scale. Some of the code examples are using a previous (old) version of the framework. I hope they will be updated for the print version.

I will like to see examples on using the MvcContrib code whenever is mentioned.
