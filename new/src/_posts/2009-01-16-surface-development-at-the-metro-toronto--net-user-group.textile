The people from Infusion came last Tuesday Jan 13th to present Surface and Surface development. They bring a Surface (device?, table?) and they walk us through some of the things you can do and what you need to develop for the Surface. 

The funny thing is that you need to have one of the tables and it cost a bit more than a laptop (more like 15 laptops) at a whooping 15.000 to get the SDK.

If you are interest most of the topics covered in the presentation are also covered in <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=386" target="_blank">this episode of .net rock.</a>
