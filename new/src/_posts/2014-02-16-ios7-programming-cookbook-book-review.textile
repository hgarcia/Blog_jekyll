h3. Overview.


"Vandad Nahavandipoor":https://twitter.com/VandadNP wrote a very well thought out book that will guide the new comer to iOS on creating a first application.

The book covers pretty much everything you will need to get your first App in the app-store.

I enjoyed how well the book is structured and how the recipes build on each other or evolve in complexity on a very natural way. It's a very practical book, so I would recommend to read it with a computer at hand and Xcode open to follow along.

h3. Conclusion

If you have not experience with iOS 7 at all and want a book that will help you to quickly get off the ground with your first up, this is the book for you.
