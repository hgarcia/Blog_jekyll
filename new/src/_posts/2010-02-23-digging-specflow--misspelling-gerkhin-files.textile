I'm a proponent of dynamic languages and I love Ruby and Cucumber but I have to admit that this is cool. I was writing a set of specifications with <a href="http://www.specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a> today and suddenly I saw this error in Visual Studio.

Double clicking the line takes you to the misspelling error in the Specification file.

I though that was really cool, specially for the slightly dyslexic programmers like myself. :-)
