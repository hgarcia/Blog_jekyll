At least two really good post today about the future RC1 for the ASP.NET MVC framework. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/12/19/asp-net-mvc-design-gallery-and-upcoming-view-improvements-with-the-asp-net-mvc-release-candidate.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Gu</a> has a very detailed post with some of the new features expected in RC1. <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/12/19/a-little-holiday-love-from-the-asp.net-mvc-team.aspx" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> talks about the delay and the improvements with the Views.

Scaffolding, views without code behind (yeah!), new HtmlHelper<TModel> and AjaxHelper<TModel> types to build strongly typed HTML and AJAX helpers (this should remove the need for magic string.

The feature that got most exited was the changes to the Views, no code behind is, IMHO the way the Views should be.

I can?t wait to put my hands in this release.
