There is a feature of Refactor that I really like and is the posibility to re-order the code (grouping fields, properties, private and public methods together) and order them alfabetically. I'm a Resharper user and I was looking for some add-in to help to achieve something similar when I came across <a target="_blank" title="NArrange the .Net code organizer " href="http://narrange.sourceforge.net/">NArrange</a>.

Install NArrange takes no time at all, this is not a VS Add-in but a console app that <a target="_blank" title="How to use NArrange" href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/codegen/narrange.aspx">can be execute from within VS as an External tool</a>.

I only found one problem using it and is that if I have the file open whem running the tool it breaks the encoding, but I ran it in another machine and I didn't find the same issue, so I need to figure out what is different between the VS configuration in those machines.

I also made a configuration to run it for only one page and the only changes are that in the arguments you need to use ItemPath and in the initial directory ItemDir:

The only problem is that when running it for a single file the using statements are moved inside the namespace and I dont like that:
