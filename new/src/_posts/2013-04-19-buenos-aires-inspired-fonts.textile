h3. Montserrat

I came across "Montserrat":http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat a few months ago while researching fonts for a new project.

Montserrat is an old neighbourhood in Buenos Aires where I spend a few years of my life while finishing secondary school.

"Julieta Ulanovsky":https://twitter.com/julietulanovsky has this to say

__The old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires called Montserrat inspired me to design a typeface that rescues the beauty of urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century.__

h3. Milonga

"Milonga":http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Milonga is a newish font (I think) from Pablo Impallari.

The font is inspired on the hand painted lettering and decorations that used to be very prominent in Buenos Aires called "fileteado porte単o":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fileteado  and that sadly have been replaced recently for more modern and cosmopolitan signage.

You can see the influence in the termination and some of the ligatures. I really like this font for headings, branding and anything that needs to be highlighted.
Upper-case letters are particularly beautiful.

h3. La porte単a

A very delicate script with hints of fileteado. "La porte単a":http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/43

h3. Tanguera

Also from sudtipos, "Tanguera":http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/109 brings some of the style from older signs you can see in Avenida de Mayo y San Telmo.
