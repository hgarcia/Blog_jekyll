I started to show Scratch to my son a few months ago. He is just 5 and even when he can't really read he had a lot of fun moving the blocks around and doing some of the exercises in the Scratch website.

So, when I saw this book from O'Reilly I got a copy and we sat together with it. He got immediately into it. He enjoys the format of the book with the full color illustrations and the overarching story.

I found that is a good way to combine reading, comics and programming in a fun and educative way.

The book is targeted for older kids what I think is clever since they can take full advantage of it. But even with the age difference he is having lots of fun.

h3. Conclusion

I will certainly recommend this book for any parent that want to introduce their kids to the subject. If you are not a programmer don't worry, the book is easy to follow along and very well written.
