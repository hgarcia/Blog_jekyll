Yesterday I received another box of books from Amazon.ca with 6 more books in it. After taking them out and putting them down into my already filled shelves I sat down and look at the pile of books. 17 computer books in all that I haven't started or haven't finished.

I decided that it was time to make a list and put some kind of priority/order on the reading ahead.
So here it goes, this is the list (in order for now) of books that I plan to read in the next 6-9 months.
