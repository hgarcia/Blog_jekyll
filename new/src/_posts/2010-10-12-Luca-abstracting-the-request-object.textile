Applications written with Luca will need access to the Request object. Jint allows for the use of .Net objects inside JavaScript, but I wanted to completely abstract Luca from anything related to the HttpContext.

The Request object in Luca at the moment has only a few properties that expose only a few of the collections and properties of the HttpRequest. This is the object literal structure.

The request is available as a property of the Luca application object. For example to access the query id you would write code like this:


<script src="http://gist.github.com/621552.js?file=request-usage.js"></script>


Of course you should always check for nulls.
