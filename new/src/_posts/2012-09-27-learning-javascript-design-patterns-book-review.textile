I like to think about this book as 3 books in one. The first 8 chapters are dedicated to explore and explain patterns, their creation process. their utility and an insight into the pattern community.

The design patterns exploration start on chapter 9 while dedicating chapter 10 exclusively to the different flavors of Model View patterns.

_If the book was only that I will be very happy, but (like in a Sunday morning infomercial, there is more!)_

Chapter 11 is an in depth discussion of the different modules systems in use today, with an special emphasis on "AMD":https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD

It depends on your knowledge of module systems, but even if you use them you may find some nuggets of information in there. I did.

Finally, the next two chapters are dedicated to design patterns in jQuery itself and exploring some of the patterns used for jQuery plug-in design.

You may find this last two chapters redundant but I think that the inclusion in the book is very wise, specially with how ubiquitous jQuery is today.

h3. Conclusion

I would add this book to a recommended reading list for any programmer that want to write good and modern JavaScript code.

"Addy Osmani":http://addyosmani.com/blog/ manage to write a very entertaining book packed with (what I think) is very relevant content on todays development.

Absolutely recommended.
