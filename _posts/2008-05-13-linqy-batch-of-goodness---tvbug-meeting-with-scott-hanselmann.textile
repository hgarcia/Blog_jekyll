<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselmann</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bethmassi/">Beth
Massi</a> both gave a presentation today at the <a href="http://www.tvbug.com/">Toronto Visual Basic User Group</a> about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx">LINQ </a>in general.

Beth created a windows form app using VB.NET, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308960.aspx">LINQ to XML</a> to and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx">LINQ to SQL</a> to read data from three different feeds and populate a simple database.

She presented some nice queries and gloat a little bit on some of the goodness of LINQ on VB, making some good spirited jokes for the C sharp guys in the audience (like myself).

Scott give us a nice preview of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb906063.aspx">Astoria</a> (ADO.NET Data Services) and show up some of the internal working, (how the magic happen as he put i). I really like that part of the presentation since I really like to know what's going when code is generated by the IDE.

Data Services allow you to present some entities as REST services, it return both XML (Atom) and Json. Data Services comes in the new VS 08 and .NET 3.5 SP1.

I will going to check it out as soon as possible.
