Early today I found the "Sweet.js project":http://sweetjs.org/ and I decided to give it a try. 

From their website:

_Sweet.js brings hygienic macros from languages like Scheme and Rust to JavaScript. Macros allow you to sweeten the syntax of JavaScript and craft the language you've always wanted._
