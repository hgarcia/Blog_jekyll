The book explain the racionality behind Dart and the use cases for it.

The book is mostly an overview of the main features of Dart and some of the tools you have available today. In it's only 20 pages (35 in the epub version on my iPad) this short book overview the characteristics of the language without getting too deep in any area in particular.

The authors "Kathy Walrath":https://plus.google.com/105904968710974272643/posts and "Seth Ladd":http://www.sethladd.com/ complement the content with multiple links to online articles where you can get reacher, more technical information.

I think it's an ok book to get a general sense of the language, maybe can be used as a quick way to introduce it to some teams.

I did learn a thing or two about Dart that I wasn't aware of, increasing my interest on it.
