I really enjoy nice typography and this interest make me explore time and again some of the several font providers out there. Sometimes for inspiration and other times is just like visiting an art gallery.

I try to keep track of new fonts that I like and I noticed that a few of the fonts I favored have been created by the same typographer.

This on it's own is not that surprising, I obviously like his style, so is perfectly understandable I like several of his fonts.

The typographer is "Pablo Impallari":http://www.impallari.com/  and I will show some of my favorite fonts

h3. Lobster, a new classic

I'm pretty sure you saw this one since it have been used in multiple popular sites.

<a href="http://www.impallari.com/lobster/" target="_blank"><img class="img-float-center" src="../../../images/posts/lobster.png" border="0" alt="The lobster font"/></a>

It's a very elegant and playful font, probably victim of it's own success. It have been used so much that I would stay away from it at least for a little while. The font has such personality that jump at you (in a good way).

Check "the site":http://www.impallari.com/lobster/ to learn more about the process and the inspiration behind it.

h3. Dosis, elegant sans-serif

This one come in seven different weights and include a few alternates.
I really like the light and medium weights due to the minimalistic design without losing personality.

h3. Cabin, where the lower case q, e, r, and m make an impression.

A very nice and balance sans. I particularly like the personality in some of the lower case letters.

The stem and termination for the r is fairly unique, as well as the termination of the letter e.

h3. Quattrocento

I like it so much that I use Quattrocento for all the content in this blog (except headers, navigation and cut outs where I choose Gentium Book Basic).

<a href="http://www.impallari.com/quattrocento/" target="_blank"><img class="img-float-center" src="../../../images/posts/quattrocento.png" border="0" alt="The quattrocento roman font"/></a>

It's a classy font with a vintage feel without sacrificing readability.

I like the Roman version better than the Sans but of course there is a place for both.


h3. Milonga

"Milonga":http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Milonga is a newish font (I think) from Impallari.

The font is inspired on the hand painted lettering and decorations that used to be very prominent in Buenos Aires called "fileteado porte√±o":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fileteado  and that sadly have been replaced recently for more modern and cosmopolitan signage.

You can see the influence in the termination and some of the ligatures. I really like this font for headings, branding and anything that needs to be highlighted.
Upper-case letters are particularly beautiful.

__There are other fonts inspired by Buenos Aires rich lettering culture, for example "Julieta Ulanovsky's Montserrat":http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat__
