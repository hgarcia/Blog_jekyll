After publishing last week "State changes, rest APIs and end points based permissions":http://blog.dynamicprogrammer.com/2013/04/20/state-changes-and-rest-apis.html I got a few questions regarding the use of "PATCH for partials updates":http://www.mnot.net/blog/2012/09/05/patch .

I think that implementing "PATCH":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902 to represent partial updates makes sense and I'm happy to see it used more and more in APIs and supported by servers and PaaS out there.

I will go as fas as to say that we all should be pushing the use of PATCH on our own APIs where it makes sense, but the use of it is irrelevant to the core of my previous post.
