__This is part 1 of a series of articles that document my efforts on building a mobile application for iOS using web technologies.__

In this series I plan to build a mobile application using primarily web technologies (HTML5, js and css). I will be targeting iOS since those are the devices I have access to at the moment, but the application should be deployable to a number of platforms without major changes due to the technologies I will be using.


h3. Overview of the application

I decided to create yet another activity tracking App. On a first iteration I will try to focus the app on tracking ski sessions. Future iterations will add tracking tailored to other outdoor activities.

The main reason to build this type of App is that it will give me a good excuse to use most of the available API's like Geo-location, accelerometer, camera, media, file, notification, storage, etc.


h3. Framework selection

I decided to use PhoneGap as the mobile framework that will enable our application to access all those API's in the devices.
I will pair PhoneGap with Angular. I think that single page application re perfectly suited to build mobile applications like this.

It took me some time to decide what UI library I wanted to use for the visual elements. It was tempting to just use Bootstrap (tried and true) once more but I wanted something focused on mobile applications.

My main target device(s) are phone(s), so I only need some limited responsiveness.

__I doubt anybody is going down the hill with the tablet on their pockets to track their speed.__

I used jQuery mobile in the pass but I wanted something different, something that feels more modern. I took a look at several frameworks after deciding to give "ionic":http://ionicframework.com/ a try.

It looks very clean, having most of the components I feel I will need and they have integration with angular out of the door. Ionic is not just a css framework but a js library of components as well.

With the set of frameworks selected, is time to...

h3. Getting started

I will assume that you already have "node.js":http://nodejs.org/ installed in your system. If you don't you may need to "install it now":http://blog.dynamicprogrammer.com/2014/02/18/installing-node-js-on-mac-osx.html



h3. Setting up the project for testing


h3. Hooking up Travis CI


h3. Next steps

We will start working with the File and Geo-location API's to track our activity and save that activity on files to upload to a server.
