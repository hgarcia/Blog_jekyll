h3. FileTransferError.code = 1

This seems to be a common error (at least for all the questions about it in the Internet). 
I hope this short post will save some time to others.

When you follow the documentation for the <span class="code">FileTransfer</span> plug-in you end up with code that looks like this.

<pre><code>
	
	var ft =  new FileTransfer();
    ft.upload(fileEntry.fullPath, encodeURI("http://domain.com/uploads"), onSuccess, onError, getFileUploadOptions(fileEntry.fullPath));

</code></pre>

If you do this you will get an error with code 1.

The solution can actually be found in the documentation of the <span class="code">file</span> plug-in. They introduced a new method to the <span class="code">FileEntry</span> object to help with this problem.

The new revised code looks like this.

<pre><code>
	
	var ft =  new FileTransfer();
    ft.upload(fileEntry.toURL(), encodeURI("http://domain.com/uploads"), onSuccess, onError, getFileUploadOptions(fileEntry.fullPath));	

</code></pre>

You will notice that for the first argument to the upload method we now use the <span class="code">toURL()</span> method of the <span class="code">FileEntry</span>, everything else stays the same.
