h3. Web programming with Erlang and Chicago boss

Since the app will be a web application (mostly an api and a few pages with heavy use of ajax), I did a quick check on Erlang based web frameworks out there.

I decided to use "Chicago Boss":http://www.chicagoboss.org/. It has decent documentation to get you started and the installation was very simple.

__I have no other real experience installing other Erlang frameworks yet. So maybe they are all this easier to install.__

Just download the tar file, uncompress, run make and you are up and running.

I had some issues with the name of the application I was trying to create and also with the location of the framework with relation to where I wanted to create my app.

I had to create the app in a folder at the same level of the framework and use lower case for the name of the application. In other words, follow the instructions :-)

I'm not sure if it's me that I'm doing something wrong but this was the only way for me to get it running.

I usually like to have framework or library code in a different location as where I have my projects. Maybe I can figure something out later.
