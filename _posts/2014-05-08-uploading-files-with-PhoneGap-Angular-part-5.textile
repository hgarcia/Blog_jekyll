__This is part 5 of a series of articles that document my efforts on building a mobile application for iOS using web technologies.__

In the previous to last post we created a series of files, each one with data from a recorded session. We want to upload that data into a server for further processing.

In this post we will add the upload mechanism and we will build a simple webserver that will receive the data.

h3. Getting the saved files

Before uploading any of the files we need to get a list of files available for upload.
We use the cordova file plugin that we already added previously to the project.

<pre><code>
	

</code></pre>

We expose the list function and we move the implementation into a private function.

<pre><code>
	
	function list(successCb, errorCb) {
      return function (fileSystem) {
        var reader = fileSystem.root.createReader();
        reader.readEntries(successCb, errorCb);
      };
    }

	... 

	list: function (successCb, errorCb) {
        window.requestFileSystem(LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT, 0, list(successCb, errorCb), errorCb);
    },

</code></pre>

h3. Next steps.
