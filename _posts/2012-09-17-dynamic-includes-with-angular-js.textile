In "a previous post":http://blog.dyamicprogramm.com/ I show how to use includes to partition views. 

I was using static includes in that example; static includes provide only limited flexibility.

What if you want to display different information on the same area of the template based on some condition?

You could use a conditional statement inside the include and render different code accordingly, but doing that will most likely result in bloated and difficult to maintain views.

h3. One solution.

You can use expression evaluation to decide what include to show. In other words, you will be making the decision sooner and keeping you includes small and focused.

<pre><code></code></pre>

h3. Conventions

Another approach is to use some convention to name your includes. Let's say that based in the status of a model you decide what inlude to shw.

You could name you includes in a way that the status is part of the name.

This approach can be used to decide between multiple views easily.

h3. Leveraging directives

Another possibility is to use a custom directive to make the decision for you.

This is probably the most flexible approach, and we can think of the directive as a factory of sorts.
