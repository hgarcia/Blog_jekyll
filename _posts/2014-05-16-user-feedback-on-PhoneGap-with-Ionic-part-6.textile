h3. Showing upload progress.

We want to report the progress of uploaded files with a simple message and a counter indicating how many have been uploaded. In the case there is an error with a file we want to show all errors at the end of the process.

Since the name of the file is not important (the user have no control on the file and there is not much he can do about the files itself), we will just indicate the number of files that errored uploading.

Once the process finishes we want to show a message that slides down from the top that indicates the result.

We can start with a very simple UI element in the home page to indicate that the upload process started.

We are also moving the upload button into the navbar and adding a small badge icon to display the number of files.
If we have no files we want to disable the button and hide the badge.

<pre><code>

	<ion-view title="New session">
	  <ion-nav-buttons side="right">
	      <button class="button button-clear icon ion-ios7-cloud-upload" ng-click="upload()" ng-disabled="uploadDisabled"></button>
	      <span class="count-badge" ng-show="totalFiles">{{totalFiles}}</span>
	  </ion-nav-buttons>
	  <ion-content class="center-child" has-header="true" padding="true">
	    <div class="info-message" ng-show="uploading">Uploading files...</div>
	    <play-stop-button click-handler="recording"></play-stop-button>
	  </ion-content>
	</ion-view>

</code></pre>

And we need to do a few changes to the <span class="code">HomeCtrl</span> as well to keep track of success and failures.

<pre><code>

	/* globals angular, console */
	angular.module('dynamic-sports.controllers')
	  .controller('HomeCtrl', ['$scope', '$timeout', '$ionicPlatform', 'geoLocationService', 'fileService', 'serverService',
	    function ($scope, $timeout, $ionicPlatform, geoLocationService, fileService, serverService) {
	    'use strict';
	    var fileName;
	    $scope.uploading = false;
	    $scope.uploadDisabled = false;

	    function onChange(newPosition) {
	      var data = newPosition.coords;
	      data.timestamp = newPosition.timestamp;
	      fileService.save(fileName, data, function () {}, function (error) {});
	    }

	    function checkUploadFinished() {
	      $scope.uploading = ($scope.totalFiles > $scope.erroredCount);
	      $scope.uploadDisabled = $scope.totalFiles === 0 || $scope.uploading;
	    }

	    function errHandler(error) {
	      $scope.erroredCount += 1;
	      checkUploadFinished();
	    }

	    function filesSaved() {
	      $timeout(function () {
	        $scope.totalFiles -= 1;
	        checkUploadFinished();
	      }, 100);
	    }

	    function uploadFiles(files) {
	      $scope.uploading = true;
	      $scope.uploadDisabled = true;
	      filesToUpload(files);
	      $scope.erroredCount = 0;
	      checkUploadFinished();
	      $timeout(function () {
	        serverService.upload(files, filesSaved, errHandler);
	      }, 100);
	    }

	    function filesToUpload(files) {
	      $timeout(function () {
	        $scope.totalFiles = files.length;
	        $scope.uploadDisabled = $scope.totalFiles === 0;
	      }, 10);
	    }

	    $scope.upload = function () {
	      fileService.list(uploadFiles, errHandler);
	    };

	    $scope.recording = function (on) {
	      if (on) {
	        fileName = geoLocationService.start(onChange, errHandler);
	      } else {
	        geoLocationService.stop();
	        $scope.totalFiles += 1;
	        $scope.uploadDisabled = false;
	      }
	    };

	    $ionicPlatform.ready(function () {
	      fileService.list(filesToUpload, errHandler);
	    });
	  }]);
</code></pre>

We check for the number of files once we load the home page and we keep track of the number of created and uploaded files.

h3. Changes on the file service.

During testing I found that the emulator reads not only the files we created but a few others from the root of the file sytem. We will create an specific folder for the tracking files to avoid problems.

We do that adding a private method on our <span class="code">fileService</span> that creates a Directory if it doesn't exist.

<pre><code>
	
	function getCreateDir(entry, successCb, errorCb) { 
	  entry.getDirectory("dynsports", {create: true, exclusive: false}, successCb, errorCb); 
	}

</code></pre>

We replace all calls to <span class="code">fileSystem.root.getFile()</span> with the result of calling this new function. For example our <span class="code">write</span> function instead of using the <span class="code">root</span> system directly:

<pre><code>

	function write(fileName, data, successCb, errorCb) {
	  return function (fileSystem) {
	    fileSystem.root.getFile(fileName, {create: true, exclusive: false}, gotFileEntry(data, successCb, errorCb), errorCb);
	  };
	}

</code></pre>

It now looks like this.

<pre><code>

	function write(fileName, data, successCb, errorCb) {
	  return function (fileSystem) {
	    getCreateDir(fileSystem.root, function (dir) {
	      dir.getFile(fileName, {create: true, exclusive: false}, gotFileEntry(data, successCb, errorCb), errorCb);
	    }, errorCb);
	  };
	}

</code></pre>

We also need to add a method to delete the files once upload finishes succesfully.

The new method looks like this.

<pre><code>
	
</code></pre>

We will call it from the <span class="code">HomeCtrl</span> inside the success call back for the upload method.

<pre><code>
	

</code></pre>


h3. Tooltip

Adding the tooltip is easy. We only need a few lines of html and this css.
