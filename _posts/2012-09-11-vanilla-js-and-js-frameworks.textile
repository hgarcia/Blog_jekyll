I recently came across the "Vanilla.js":http://vanilla-js.com/ site and I couldn't avoid but to smile.

I have no idea who the authors are or what are their intensions, but I think it's a good reminder of the power of JavaScript for programmers coming to the language in these times of plentiful frameworks.

h3. Blame the browser vendors.
