Early today I was listening to the ".Net Rocks episode 807":http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=807 with "Bill Wagner":http://billwagner.cloudapp.net/ in witch "Carl Franklin":http://carlfranklin.net/ joked about exposing the back end of a calculator as a REST web service. I was walking to the subway when he made the joke and I couldn't stop laughing.

While at the platform, waiting for the train, I started to think about how to implement it.

__I'm not suggesting this is a proper REST implementation, just an intellectual exercise during a subway ride.__

h3. Resources

The first thing is to figure out what resources to expose.
