I took a bit of time to add TCP support to "distro":https://www.npmjs.org/package/distro

Now you can create a network of client servers with TCP, UDP4 and UDP6.

The TCP servers use the same Message types.

I took the time to improve the documentation (I think is completed now).

I also added two more examples (server and client) for TCP.

As part of the effort the code was refactored a bit allowing for easier extensibility.

Enjoy!
